New Task came out:

1) Init SLS with new Task and run SLS

2) Convert GlobalPlan -> Etape

3) Look into the furure:
	- Probability of adding tasks into path
	- Probability of adding tasks close to path 	-> what potential for this path with the new task?

4) Check adversaries' behavior 
	- Compute SLS of the adversaries

5) Create bid
	- Compute average bid for each adversary -> take the lowest? (or average again, ...)
	- Compute difference between our and its mean
	- Update bid value, with inertia, considering the difference of the means to adjust our mean to it.
